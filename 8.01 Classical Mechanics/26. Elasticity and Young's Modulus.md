## Elasticity of Materials

When we take a spring, something that we are so familiar with now, and the spring has length \\(l\\) in a relaxed state, spring constant \\(k\\), I can extend the spring with some force that I apply.

![Extending a Spring][1]

The spring, then, will counter it with the spring force and it will be in equilibrium there.

I call this the zero position, and let's call this now \\(\Delta l\\) instead of \\(x\\), which we have done before.

If I double the force, \\(\Delta l\\) will double.

Hooke's Law says that the force is linear with \\(\Delta l\\); in other words, \\(\Delta l \\propto F\\).

Nothing new, as long as Hooke's Law holds.

If I make the spring twice as long, I would get double the extension, because when I have two springs in series, each one, under the influence of this force, will get longer by this amount.

Since I have two springs in series, I will get twice \\(\Delta l\\).

So \\(\Delta l \propto l\\).

If I take two springs in parallel, one like so and one like so, relaxed length \\(l\\), both the same spring constant \\(k\\), and if now I apply a force on it, then each one of these spring forces is only half of the applied force.

![Spring in Parallel][2]

Together they counter the applied force.

In other words, the extension \\(\Delta l\\) that I obtain from this external force is now only half as much as it would be with one spring, and if I had three springs parallel, all identical, I would only get one-third of the extension for a given force.

In other words, \\(\Delta l \propto \frac{1}{\text{# of spring}}\\), assuming that they are identical springs.

Now I'm going to use a rod or wire which has cross-sectional area \\(A\\) and length \\(l\\), and I'm going to apply a force at one end.

![Apply Force to a Rod][3]

As a result of that force it will get longer by a certain amount \\(\Delta l\\), exactly like the spring.

And clearly, when I make this force stronger, \\(\Delta l\\) will increase, and as long as Hooke's Law holds that the spring force provided by the rod balances this out

provided that the \\(F_s \propto \Delta l\\)

I have again that \\(\Delta l \propto F\\).

Double the force, I get twice \\(\Delta l\\).

If I put two of these rods together, so I double the length of the rod, then clearly I will get twice \\(\Delta l\\), because each rod will experience the force, each rod will get longer by \\(\Delta l\\), and so 2 rods will get longer by \\(2\Delta l\\).

So again, \\(\Delta l \propto l\\).

Suppose now, I have two of these rods next to each other, notice the analogy with the two parallel springs here, and I apply a force \\(F\\).

![Rod in Parallel][4]

Then the spring force on each one of them, if I call that the spring force, will only have to be half to counter this force.

So they both have a cross-sectional area \\(A\\), and so now with double the cross-sectional area, I get only half of \\(\Delta l\\).

And so now we have a situation that if I made a rod whereby this was \\(2A\\), just one rod, which is completely equivalent to this situation, I'm only getting half \\(\frac{1}{2}\Delta l\\) for a given force.

And so now we have that \\(\Delta l \propto \frac{1}{A}\\).

So now we can make up the balance, and we can say, "Aha! \\(\Delta l \propto \frac{F \cdot l}{A}\\)."

Hence, 
\\[\frac{F}{A} = Y \frac{\Delta l}{l}\\]

where Y is called __Young's modulus__.

\\(F \over A\\), which has the dimension of pressure, force per unit area, is what we call __stress__.

And \\(\Delta l \over l\\), which is dimensionless, we call that __strain__.

If we compare two rods with different values of Young's modulus, then the one with the smaller value of \\(Y\\) for the same stress will give you a larger strain.

In other words, it's easier to make it longer.

If Young's modulus is very high, then the rod is extremely stiff.

Then it is very difficult to make the rod longer.

I have here for you some numbers which, of course, are on the Web so you don't have to copy them.

> TODO: Young's modulus for various metals and Nylon

And you have Young's modulus there for various metals, and I also have it down there for nylon, and today we will work with that quite extensively.

We could first do a simple example just to get a feeling for what is at stake here.

__Example__

\\(r = 0.5\ cm\\)

\\(A = 8 \times 10^{-5}\ m^2\\)

\\(l = 1\ m\\)

\\(M = 500\ kg\\)

\\(F = 5000\ N\\)

So I can now ask myself how much longer is this rod going to be?

\\[\Delta l = \frac{F \cdot l}{A \cdot Y} = \frac{6.3 \times 10^7}{Y} \\]

And so now we can look at steel as an example.

\\(Y = 20 \times 10^{10}\ N/m^2\\)

And we substitute that in here, and we find that we get an extension 

\\(\Delta l = 0.3\ mm\\)

Think about this: steel rod, a centimeter thick, and it has a length of one meter, and I hang 500 kg on it and it only gets longer by 0.3 mm.

You couldn't even see that.

However, if you go and make the rod, which would be really a rope...

If you make it out of nylon, which has Young's modulus...

Oh, well, it's 55 times lower.

I don't have to use that number.

It's about 55 times lower, so the \\(\Delta l\\) will then be 55 times larger.

And so, instead of a 0.3 mm, I will get something like 17 mm.

And that you can see with your naked eye.

I take a rope yay thick of nylon.

I hang 500 kg on it and I will see it gets longer by 1.7 cm.

You can see that right in front of your eyes.

If I start adding more weight on these bars, then very interesting things are going to happen as we will discuss today.

One thing which is obvious that will ultimately happen if you keep loading down, keep adding mass, it will break.

And the breaking point is given there in the third column, and we call that the __ultimate tensile strength__.

So when \\(\frac{F}{A}\\) becomes too large, that's what it comes down to, then it will simply break.

If we take the case that we have here, the steel rod, for which \\(\frac{F}{A} = 6.3 \times 10^7\ N/m^2\\) because \\(l = 1\ m\\), then you can look there under steel that it wouldn't break.

We would be very safe, because it wouldn't break until \\(\frac{F}{A} = 5 \times 10^8\ N/m^2\\).

So we're a factor of ten away from that. There's no problem.

Even nylon would be very safe, because that wouldn't break until \\(\frac{F}{A} = 3 \times 10^8\ N/m^2\\).

However, if we chose aluminum, if we made the bar out of aluminum, then you're very close to this number \\(6.3 \times 10^7\\).

And so if you add a little bit more mass than 500 kg, your aluminum bar would break.

So you see, the properties of these metals are very, very different indeed.

Now, before it breaks, we reach a situation that the strain is no longer proportional to the stress.

In other words, we abandon Hooke's Law, as I will show you also today with a demonstration.

The material begins to deform.

It begins to flow, in a way.

And even when you take the weights off, it will no longer have its original length.

It will not return to the original length but it will be much longer.

And I will try to sketch you here what a curve of stress versus strain typically looks like.

![Stress vs Strain Graph][5]

In the beginning, you will see a portion that is linear.

That's Hooke's Law.

And then, when you keep adding force, which we will do by gravity, we will just hang weights on it, then it starts to bend over, up to a point here which we call the __elastic limit__.

And even though this portion is no longer linear, so even though Hooke's Law no longer holds, still, if you take the weight off the wire, off the rod, it will still come back to zero.

Once you are past this point, that is no longer the case.

You will now see also that a small increase of stress will give a huge strain, so the rod will get very long all of a sudden with a little bit of extra stress.

And if now you were to take the weight off the rod, it would not come back to zero but it would come back longer so it's permanently deformed.

And in general the rod gets hot, and the work that you have done goes into heat and goes into the deformation of the rod.

And so it goes like this and then it goes like this and here it breaks.

At this value for \\(\frac{F}{A}\\), which is that third column there, it will break.

I'd like to discuss with you this horizontal portion.

With a little bit of luck we may actually be able to see that with my demonstration, but it's hard to get exactly at that point.

If this part of the curve is horizontal, it means that without any increase of \\(\frac{F}{A}\\), the wire will continue to get longer and longer, and we call that __plastic flow__.

So this whole portion here is plastic flow.

It almost becomes like a liquid.

And then right here there is something very strange that is happening.

Then when it breaks, the stress actually becomes lower, and this is something I can never show you in class, but I can explain to you why that happens.

When you are past this point here, the rod begins to pinch, and you get this.

![Why stress is lowered before object breaks][6]

It's unpredictable where it will pinch, but somewhere it will start to pinch so that the area here is \\(A'\\) whereas the cross-sectional area here is \\(A\\).

\\[\frac{F}{A'} > \frac{F}{A}\\].

If you could do this experiment in a controlled fashion, and there are machines designed to do that, then you could actually lower \\(\frac{F}{A}\\) so that the stress actually goes down but that \\(\frac{F}{A'}\\) would still go up, and therefore \\(\Delta l\\) will increase.

And there are machines who are specially designed to test these metals, and what they do is they go up in very small steps of \\(F\\) and so they trace this whole curve, but by the time that they get into the plastic flow area, before they increase the force, they decrease it first.

And if \\(\Delta l\\) gets larger when they decrease it, they continue to decrease it, and so that's the way that they can map out also this portion.

But we will not be able to do that.

There are metals which are extremely brittle, and even though the curve would look very similar, it has all these characteristics, this point, then, would lie all the way here.

So this whole curve, then, is squeezed into very small parameter space of the strain.

## Measuring Stress vs. Strain

And so I want you to see most of this, at least some of this, and we do that with a demonstration which we have there, and I will make a drawing of the basic idea.

![Measuring Stress vs. Strain (Before)][7]

We have a copper wire and we attach to the copper wire a rod, a solid rod.

And at the end of the solid rod is a mirror.

This is a mirror.

And we're going to hang weights on here.

But this mirror is on a little platform and can pivot at this point but cannot lower itself.

The platform is fixed.

For those of you who are very close, this is where that platform is.

That is a fixed platform.

And so the mirror can only tilt but cannot go down.

And so now I will show you what happens when this wire gets longer.

![Measuring Stress vs. Strain (After)][8]

So here is the wire, and this is where the rod is attached.

But now the wire has become longer.

So the wire is now longer by an amount \\(\Delta l\\).

So this is now the point where this bar, this rod is attached.

And so the mirror will now be like this.

We have tilted the mirror.

And we have tilted the mirror over an angle \\(\Delta \theta\\), and this length is \\(l\\).

And we're going to load it down with a mass \\(M\\), which we're going to increase.

And then we have a laser beam which we shine onto the mirror.

The laser beam comes in like so.

And this is the normal to the mirror, so this angle here is \\(\Delta \theta\\).

The laser beam bounces off and returns like so, and this angle, of course, is also \\(\Delta \theta\\).

That's the property of a mirror.

Here's the laser, it goes into the mirror, and the spot there of that return is all the way there on the wall.

So we are going to show you where this spot is on the wall, and the wall is very far away.

It's a distance \\(L\\) from the wire.

And you'll see very shortly why we do it that way.

Let me first give you the dimensions of this instrument.

\\(l = 36\ cm\\)

_Cu_

\\(d = 7.5\ cm\\)

\\(L = 16\ m\\)

\\(2r = 0.02\ in\\)

I give it in terms of the diameter because that's the way that the manufacturer gives it to us.

\\(A = 2.0 \times 10^{-7}\ m^2\\)

All right, notice that 

\\(\Delta \theta \approx \frac{\Delta l}{d}\\)

The light that returns hits the wall there at a distance \\(L\\), and I call that displacement at the wall \\(\Delta y\\).

\\(\frac{\Delta y}{L} \approx 2\Delta \theta\\)

This is a small-angle approximation; it's a very good approximation, and \\(\theta\\) is in radians.

\\[\Delta y \approx \frac{2L \cdot \Delta l}{d} \\]

And look what we have done now: We have convert something that is immeasurable, \\(\Delta l\\) which is fraction of millimeters--

we have convert that to something on the wall that we can measure, because this ratio, \\(2L \over d\\), in our case, for the dimensions that I have chosen, is about 425; it's like a magnification factor.

So if we see a displacement of that laser beam on the wall of 40 cm, which is easy to see, it means that the wire got longer by only 1 mm.

So 40 cm there translates to 1 mm there, and if we would see that laser beam go up 4 m, it would mean that the wire would only have become 1 cm longer.

So it is a wonderful way to magnify the effect and to measure it.

So I will now make an attempt to load down the copper wire.

Oh, we can actually leave this here, so you can see that curve.

So we start to load up with 0.5 kg.

We will write down, then, how much that laser spot goes up on the wall.

And then, in between increasing the weight, increasing the force we will take the masses off to see whether the length of the rod returns to the original length.

And you will see after a while that you get permanent deformation, then it no longer comes back to its original length.

In other words the laser spot will not return to zero on the wall but it will stay higher.

So, here is that copper wire which will be hard to see for some of you--

it's only 20/1,000 of an inch thick--

and here is that mirror which can pivot and can tilt.

And Ron is going to put weights on here, and then we will take the weights off in between and we will try to construct a curve of the stress versus strain, except that it is practical for me to put here just the mass--

how many kilograms we have on there--

because we know what \\(A\\) is, so we can calculate \\(F \over A\\).

That's not so important now.

And here I simply have \\(\Delta y\\).

But keep in mind that \\(\Delta y\\) is always 425 times larger than \\(\Delta l\\).

So we're going to plot it, and we're going to see whether we can come up with a curve that is somewhat similar to that one.

The mirror always starts to oscillate a little bit and so we have to be a little patient, and in the beginning, you may be bored because we're going through that linear part of the curve.

![Plot of Stress vs. Strain][9]

And so we can now actually make an attempt to calculate Young's modulus from the data.

Of course, you'll have to select a portion where you think that the data are reasonably linear.

\\[Y = \frac{F}{A}\frac{l}{\Delta l}\\]
 
And so now it's a matter of where do we think that Hooke's Law still holds? 

I think this whole portion would be fine, so we could take this point as well as this point, because anywhere on this straight line, you will get the same value for Young's modulus.

So I will use 2 kg and 20 cm

\\(F = 200\ N\\)

\\(\Delta y = 20\ cm\\)

\\(\Delta l = \frac{20}{425}\ cm\\)

\\(A = 2 \times 10^{-7}\ m^2\\)

\\(l = 0.36\ m\\)

\\(Y = 7.7 \times 10^{10}\ N/m^2\\)

> Young's modulus for copper is \\(11.0 \times 10^{10}\ N/m^2\\)

We can also measure the ultimate tensile strength.

That is, we can measure the value for \\(F \over A\\) when it broke.

So that happened, I think, at 8 kg?

\\[\frac{F}{A} = \frac{80}{2 \times 10^{-7}} = 4 \times 10^8\ N/m^2\\]

And that's not bad.

It's a little higher than we have there, but it's a very crude measurement.

> Ultimate tensile strength for copper is \\(3.2 \times 10^8\ N/m^2\\)

And don't forget, we were unable to follow the portion when it was going down.

We only went up in mass, in weight, and so that value there takes into account that the curve comes down, something we could not do.

We didn't have the means of doing that.

The percentage strain is actually extremely low in the portion that the curve is linear.

You can ask yourself the question "What is \\(\frac{\Delta l}{l}\\) in terms of percentages during this portion here?"

We take the case where we sort of reach the end of the Hooke's Law parameter space, we have 

\\[\frac{\Delta l}{l} = \frac{20/425 \times 10^{-2}\ m}{0.36\ m} = 1.3 \times 10^{-3} = 0.13\%\\]

So the wire, when it reaches the end of its Hooke's Law parameter space, has only become longer by 0.13%.

And when the wire breaks...

In general, for metals it's maybe 5 ~ 10% longer than its original length.

That's a typical value for metals.

## Spring Constant of a Wire

Now, as long as I am in the linear portion of the curve, I can generate a simple harmonic motion.

Because in the linear portion of the curve where Hooke's Law holds, I could hang a weight on the rope or on the rod and I could let it oscillate vertically.

\\[F = -\frac{Y \cdot A}{l}\Delta l\\]

And so this is similar to \\(F = -kx\\) that you have seen with the spring.

\\[k = \frac{Y \cdot A}{l}\\]

And so you can predict that it will start to oscillate with an angular frequency of

\\[\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\\]

\\[T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\\]

If we take our copper wire, we know what \\(Y\\) is.

\\(Y = 11 \times 10^10\ N/m^2\\)

\\(k = 5 \times 10^4\ N/m\\)

So if now I hang on it a mass of 1 kg, I can calculate the period of one oscillation, and \\(1/T\\) is the frequency \\(f\\).

\\(f = 38\ Hz\\)

So it would start to oscillate like this, 38 times per second, and if I hang 2 kg on it, then this frequency would become something like 25 Hz, because a higher mass gives me a longer period, gives me a lower frequency.

## Speed of Sound in Materials

The speed of sound also depends on Young's modulus.

Without proof, you will see this if you ever take 8.03--

I will tell you that 

\\[v_{sound} = \sqrt{\frac{Y}{\rho}}\\]

where \\(\rho\\) is the density of the material.

And so the higher Young's modulus is, the higher the speed of sound is, and that is intuitively sort of pleasing.

I can sort of understand that although the square root is hard to see.

If I have here a rod, a bar and I give this bar here a bang, I hit it, if this bar were infinitely stiff, that means Young's modulus were infinitely high, then the bar would instantaneously move here when I hit it there.

But if the bar is not infinitely stiff, if it has a certain amount of elasticity, then what happens... then I hit it here and I produce here some kind of local increased pressure which is going to propagate to this end--

it's like a pressure wave, like sound is a pressure wave--

and that takes time.

And the larger Young's modulus is, the stiffer the material is, the faster that will go.

If Young's modulus is very low, the material is more elastic.

It will take a longer time for this pulse to reach this end.

So it is sort of intuitively pleasing for me that the stiffness of the material is related to the speed of sound.

I have here a magnesium bar, and the magnesium bar has a length \\(l\\).

And I can calculate the speed of sound for magnesium by taking its Young's modulus, divided by \\(\rho\\), and I come up with the speed of sound about 5 km/s.

If you look at those numbers, they are all substantially higher than the speed of sound in air, which is only some 340 m/s.

So the speed of sound for magnesium is some 15 times larger than the speed of sound in air.

If this bar has a length \\(l\\), this pressure disturbance will start to move to the left, and then it'll come back here, so it will have made a complete journey, which I call the period...

\\[T = \frac{2L}{v_{sound}}\\]

And so the frequency of this bar--

\\[f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{v_{sound}}{2L}\\]

Now, for those of you who will take 8.03 in the future, you will see a much better derivation of this frequency, so this is a poor man's version.

The speed of sound is about 5 km/s.

The length of the bar is about 122 cm, and so that translates into a frequency of roughly 2,100 ~ 2,200 Hz.

So the frequency for this magnesium bar is about 2,100 Hz, and you can hear that.

## Demo with a 2kg Block and Two Strings

Remember earlier in the course that we were wrestling with this problem.

We had a block and we had two strings attached to it.

![Block with Two Strings][10]

And so we argued if you increase \\(F\\) and if the strings are identical that it should break first at top and then at bottom, because the breaking point where the force is too large for the string will occur first at top because you have the extra amount \\(Mg\\).

But yet when we jerked on it very fast, it would break at bottom, and when we pulled very slowly, it would break at the top.

And now we can fully understand that.

Because what does it mean, that the top string is going to break? 

It means that the top string has to get longer by a certain amount \\(\Delta l\\) before it breaks.

For this string to get longer by a certain amount \\(\Delta l\\), this block has to come down.

Now, if I pull here with a certain force 

\\(F = Ma\\)

the block will come down with an acceleration \\(a\\), and in the time \\(\Delta t\\), it will move over a distance \\(\frac{1}{2}a (\Delta t)^2 = \Delta l\\).

But that takes time to reach the \\(\Delta l\\) at which it wants to break, and so if I pull very fast, I don't give it that time.

And that's why, then, the one at the bottom will break, and if I pull very slowly, the one at the top will break.
