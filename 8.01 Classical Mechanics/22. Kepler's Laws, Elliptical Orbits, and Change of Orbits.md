## Kepler's Laws and Elliptical Orbits

### Review on Circular Orbits

There's an object with mass \\(m\\) going in a circle around \\(M\\).

![Circular Orbit][1]

(1) \\[T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 R^3}{G M}\\]

> found by setting centripetal force equal to gravitational force

(2) \\[v = \frac{2\pi R}{T} = \sqrt{\frac{MG}{R}}\\]

(3) \\[E_{total} = K + U = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{mMG}{R} = -\frac{mMG}{2R}\\]

(4) \\[v_{escape} = \sqrt{2}v = \sqrt{\frac{2MG}{R}}\\]

> found by setting \\(E_{total} = 0\\)

For near Earth orbits, the period to go around the Earth is about 90 minutes, and the speed is about 8 km/s, and the escape velocity from that orbit would be about 11.2 km/s.

And for the Earth going around the Sun, the period would be about 365 days, and the speed of the Earth in orbit is about 30 km/s.

Now, circular orbits are special.

In general, bound orbits are ellipses, even though I must add to it that most orbits of our planets in our solar system are very close to circular, but not precisely circular.

But the general solutions call for an elliptical orbit.

And I first want to discuss with you the three famous laws by Kepler from the early 17th century.

__Kepler's Three Laws__

1. the orbits are ellipses and the Sun is at one focus. (~1618)

2. Equal areas in equal times.

	![Equal Area in Equal Times][2]

	>	Somehow, it has the smell of some conservation of angular momentum.

3. \\(T^2 \propto (\text{mean distance})^2\\)

I will show you here the data that Kepler had available in 1618, largely from the work done by, of course, astronomers, observers like Tycho Brahe and others.

You see here the six planets that were known at the time, and the mean distance to the Sun.

For the Earth, it is one because we work in astronomical units.

Everything is referenced to the distance of the Earth.

This is 150 million kilometers.

And it takes the Earth 365 days to go around the Sun; Jupiter, about 12 years; and Saturn, about 30 years.

And then when he takes this number to the power of three and this number squared, and he divides the two, then he gets numbers which are amazingly constant.

And that is his third law.

The third law leads immediately to the inverse square dependence of gravity, which he was not aware of, but Newton later put that all together.

But he very jubilantly writes:

> I first believed I was dreaming ..... But it is absolutely certain and exact that the ratio which exists between the periodic times of any two planets is precisely the ratio of the 3/2th power of the mean distance.

And he wrote that in 1619.

So, orbits in general are ellipses.

And now I want to review with you what I have there on the blackboard about ellipses.

![Elliptical Orbit][3]

If \\(M\\) were the Earth, then we would call the point of closest approach "perigee," and the point farthest away from the Earth, we would call that "apogee." If \\(M\\) were the Sun, we would call that "aphelion" and "perihelion."

> \\(AP = 2a\\) where \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis

(5) \\[ E_{total} = K + U = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{mMG}{r} = -\frac{mMG}{2a}\\]

> \\(r\\) and \\(v\\) now changes with time

> result not proven in the lecture

(6) \\[T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{MG}\\]

\\[v_{escape} = \sqrt{\frac{2MG}{r}}\\]

If you have various orbits which have the same semimajor axis, that the period is the same and the energy is the same, and that is by no means obvious.

![Same Semimajor Axis, Same Period and Energy][4]

## Elliptical Orbit from Initial Conditions

![Elliptical Orbit from Initial Conditions][5]

\\(AP = 2a\\)

__Initial conditions:__

* \\(M, v_0, \vec{r}_0, \phi_0 \\)

And now I'm going to ask you, 

1. Can we find out from these initial conditions how long it takes for this object to go around? 
2. Can we find out what \\(QP\\) is? 
3. Can we find out what the semimajor axis is? 
4. Can we find out what the velocity is at point \\(P\\), at closest approach when this angle is 90 degrees? 
5. Can we find out what the velocity is when the object, \\(m\\), is farthest away at apogee? 

The answer is yes.

\\(a\\) is the easiest to find--the semimajor axis.

I turn to equation number five, which is the conservation of mechanical energy.

\\[E_{total} = K + U = \frac{1}{2} m v_0^2 - \frac{mMG}{r} = -\frac{mMG}{2a}\\]

\\[\frac{1}{2}v_0^2 - \frac{MG}{r} = -\frac{MG}{2a}\\]

\\[a = \frac{GMr}{r v_0^2 - 2GM}\\]

If the total energy were positive, then \\(a\\) has to be negative.

That's physical nonsense, of course, so this only holds for bound orbits.

So positive values for \\(E_{total}\\) are not allowed.

If you now apply equation number six, immediately pops out \\(T\\), the orbital periods, because the only thing you didn't know yet was \\(a\\), but you know \\(a\\) now.

(6) \\[T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{MG}\\]

So we also know how long it takes for the object to go around in orbit.

__Example:__

1. \\(M = 6 \times 10^{24}\text{ kg}\\)
2. \\(r_0 = 9000\text{ km}\\)
3. \\(v_0 = 9.0\text{ km/s}\\)
4. \\(\phi_0 = 120^{o}\\)

So with equation number five, I then pop out \\(a\\).

Right? Because that's one equation with one unknown, and I put in the numbers and I find that \\(a\\) is quite large.

\\(a \approx 50,000\text{ km}\\) 

Remember, it starts off at 9,000 kilometers, but \\(a\\) is 50,000 kilometers.

That means \\(2a\\) is 100,000 kilometers.

Why is that so large? 

Well, the answer lies in evaluating the escape velocity.

The escape velocity of this little mass when it is at position \\(D\\), for which these are the input parameters, is \\(\sqrt{\frac{2MG}{r_0}} = 9.4\text{ km/s}\\).

Well, if you need 9.4 km/s to make it out to infinity, and you have 9 km/s, you're pretty close already.

So that's the reason why this semimajor axis is indeed such a horrendous number.

If now I use equation number six, then I find the period, and I find that it takes about 31 hours for this object to go around the Earth.

Now we want to know what the situation is with perigee and with apogee.

1. Can we calculate the distance \\(QP\\)? 
2. Can we calculate the speed at location \\(P\\) and at location \\(A\\)? 

Now we're going to apply for the first time in systems like this, the conservation of angular momentum.

Angular momentum is conserved about this point \\(Q\\), but only about that point \\(Q\\).

> no torque on \\(m\\) about point \\(Q\\)

What is the magnitude of that angular momentum? 

When the object is at \\(D\\), \\(\left| L_Q \right| = m v_0 r_0 sin(\phi_0)\\).

This is the situation at \\(D\\).

Why do we have \\(sin(\phi_0)\\)? 

Because we have \\(\vec{r} \times \vec{v}\\), and with a cross product, you have the sine of the angle.

So that's the situationat point \\(D\\).

What is the situation at point \\(P\\)?

Well, at point \\(P\\),the velocity vector is perpendicular to the line \\(QP\\), so the sine of that angle is one.

\\(\left| L_Q \right| = m v_P QP\\).

And you can do the same for point A.

\\(\left| L_Q \right| = m v_A QA\\).

I'm not doing that.

You will see shortly why I'm not doing that.

Nature is very kind.

Nature's going to give me that last part for free.

This, by the way, is the conservation of angular momentum about that point Q where the mass is located.

I have here one equation with two unknowns--\\(v_P\\) and \\(QP\\).

So I need another equation.

We have also the conservation of mechanical energy.

\\(E\_{total} = \frac{1}{2} m v_P^2 - \frac{mMG}{QP} = -\frac{mMG}{2a}\\)

And now I have two equations with two unknowns--\\(v_P\\) and \\(QP\\)-- and so I can solve for both.

Notice that this second equation is a quadratic equation in \\(v_P\\) so you're going to get two solutions, and the two solutions--

one wil be \\(v_P\\) and will give you the distance \\(QP\\).

The other one will be \\(v_A\\), which gives you the distance \\(QA\\).

How come that we get both solutions? 

Well, this is only a stupid equation.

This equation doesn't know that I used a subscript \\(P\\).

I could have used a subscript \\(A\\) here and put in here \\(QA\\).

That's the term that I left out.

And therefore, when I solve the equations, I get both \\(v_P\\) and \\(v_A\\) because those are the situations that the velocity vector is perpendicular to the position vector.

And if I use now our numerical results, and I solve for you that quadratic equation--two equations with two unknowns--then I find that \\(QP \approx 6.6 \times 10^{3}\text{ km}\\).

It means that it's only 200 kilomeers above the arth's surface.

At that low altitude, this orbit will not last very long, and the satellite will reenter into the Earth's atmosphere.

And it leads to a speed at point \\(v_P = 10.7\text{ km/s}\\).

My second solution then is that \\(QA\\) turns out to be huge.

No surprise because we know that the semimajor axis is 50,000 km.

We find \\(QA = 9.3 \times 10^4\text{ km}\\), and we find for \\(v_A = 0.75\text{ km/s}\\).

Immediate result from the conservation of angular momentum that \\(QP v_P  =  QA v_A\\).

That's immediate consequence of the conservation of angular momentum.

And when I add this up, \\(QA + QP = 2a = 10^5\text{ km}\\).

So now we know everything there is to be known about this ellipse, and that came from the initial conditions from the four numbers that I gave you.

## Changing from Circular to Elliptical Orbits

Now I want to get into a subject which is quite difficult, and it has to do with change of orbits.

Burning a rocket when you are in orbit and your orbit will change.

And I will do it only for some simplified situations.

I start off with a circular orbit, and I will fire the rocket in such a way that my velocity will either increase or decrease exactly tangentially to the orbit.

So this is our circular orbit with radius \\(R\\), and at location \\(X\\),at 12:00, that is where I fire my rocket.

![Changing Orbits][6]

I blast my rocket in the direction opposite of the motion, and so the speed will now increase.

I add kinetic energy, and now I have a new speed which is higher.

If my speed is higher, then my total energy has increased.

I increased the kinetic energy.

The burn of the rocket is so short that I can consider after the burn that the object is still at \\(X\\).

So the kinetic energy has increased; the potential energy is the same, so the total energy is up.

And therefore, \\(E_{\text{total}} > E_{\text{total circular}}\\).

But if that's the case, then clearly \\(2a > 2R\\).

I now go into an elliptical orbit because the new velocity is no longer the right velocity for a circular orbit.

And so what's going to happen--

I'm going to get an elliptical orbit like so, whereby \\(2a > 2R\\) because my total energy is larger.

And you see that immediately when you go to equation number five.

If you increase the total energy, then your \\(a\\) will go up.

Okay, so \\(2a > 2R\\).

That also means that the period \\(T > T_{\text{circular}}\\).

My other option is that I'm going to fire the rocket when I spew out gas against the motion, so I take kinetic energy out.

So after the burn, my speed is lower.

When I take kinetic energy out, \\(E_{\text{total}} < E_{\text{total circular}}\\), \\(2a < 2R\\), \\(T < T_{\text{circular}}\\), and therefore, my new ellipse will look like this.

And so these are the three situations that I want you to carefully look at because I'm going to need them in the next very dramatic story which has to do with the romance between Peter and Mary.

## Astronauts Pass a Ham Sandwich

Peter and Mary are two astronauts, and they are both in orbit in one and the same orbit around the Earth.

![Romance between Peter and Mary][7]

This is where Peter is at this moment, at that location \\(X\\), and this is where Mary is.

They are in exactly the same orbit, but different satellites.

They go around like this, and they are at a distance from each other which I will express in terms of a fraction \\(f\\) of the total circumference, so that this arc equals \\(f 2\pi R\\).

That's how far they are apart.

And that means for Mary to make it all the way back to point \\(X\\) would be \\((1-f) 2\pi R\\).

Mary forgot her lunch, radios Peter and says, "Peter, I have on food." Peter feels very sorry for her, says, "No sweat. I will throw you a ham sandwich." 

So Peter prepares a ham sandwich and wants to throw it to Mary in such a way that Mary can make the catch.

How can Peter possibly do this? 

Well, the best way, the most obvious way to do it is to make an orbit for the ham sandwich whose orbital period is exactly the same as this time for Mary to make it back to \\(X\\).

And I will be more specific by giving you some numbers.

Then you can digest that better.

\\(R =  7,000\text{ km}\\)

\\(f = 0.05\\)

\\(f 2\pi R \approx 2200\text{ km}\\)

If you know the radius \\(R\\), then, of course, the velocity of the astronauts follows immediately.

\\(v_a = 7.55\text{ km/s}\\)

And what is also nonnegotiable is the period to go around, which is \\(T = 97\text{ min}\\).

All of that follows from this \\(R\\).

Okay, if it takes 97 minutes to go around, then 5% of 97 minutes is 5 minutes, if I round it off.

95% of 97 minutes is 92 minutes.

So for Mary to go around and go back to point X is 92 minutes, rounded-off numbers.

So if I can give my sandwich an orbit which has a period of 92 minutes, I've got it made because after 92 minutes, the sandwich will come back to \\(X\\) and Mary is at \\(X\\).

It's important that you get that idea.

If you get that idea, then all the rest will follow.

So the period of the sandwich after the throw of Peter is shorter--maybe he has to throw backwards.

If that period is 92 minutes, when Mary is here, she will catch the sandwich.

And so the necessary condition for this first solution, which is an obvious one, is to make \\(T_s = (1-f)T_a\\).

So then Mary will be back at point \\(X\\).

What is the orbital period of the sandwich after the throw? 

\\(T_s = \sqrt{\frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{GM}} = (1-f)\sqrt{\frac{4\pi^2 R^3}{GM}}\\)

That is a necessary condition.

Look, we lose \\(M\\), we lose \\(G\\), we lose 4, we lose \\(\pi\\).

What don't we lose? 

Well, what we don't lose is 

\\(a^{3/2} = (1-f) R^{3/2}\\)

\\(\therefore a = R (1-f)^{2/3}\\).

And this is an amazingly simple result.

It means if you know the orbit of Peter and Mary, which is \\(R\\), and if you know how far the two lovers are apart, which is expressed in this \\(f\\), then you know what the semimajor axis is of the sandwich orbit.

That comes immediately out of this equation.

But once you know the semimajor axis, you can immediately calculate, with equation five, the speed of the sandwich.

(5) \\[-\frac{mMG}{2a} = \frac{1}{2}m v_s^2 - \frac{mMG}{R}\\]

This happens at location \\(X\\) after Peter has thrown because the sandwich is still at location \\(X\\), but Peter has changed its speed to \\(v_s\\).

And so once you know \\(a\\), this equation immediately gives you \\(v_s\\), and once you know \\(v_s\\), then you know with what speed Peter should throw.

Well, let us work it out in detail in the example that we have there.

If we calculate \\(a\\) with the numbers that we have there, then I find that \\(a = 6,765\text{ km}\\).

Notice that this is smaller than \\(R\\).

It better be, because it's clear that after the sandwich is thrown, that we get a smaller ellipse.

We want this time to go around to be less time than Peter to go around.

And if this time is less than the time that it takes Peter to go around, he has to throw the sandwich backwards, and therefore, you expect that the semimajor axis will be smaller than \\(R\\), and it is.

The speed of the sandwich, which follows then from equation number six, which was the conservation of mechanical energy, is \\(7.42\text{ km/s}\\).

Now, what matters is not so much what the speed of the sandwich is, but what matters for Peter is what is the speed that he will have to give the sandwich, which is \\(v_s - v_a = -0.13\text{ km/s}\\).

And the minus sign indicates that he has to throw the sandwich backwards.

Now, \\(0.13\text{ km/s} = 300\text{ mph}\\), which is a little tough, even for Peter.

And so we have to look for different solutions.

This won't work.

This was an easy one, but it doesn't work.

Well, there is no reason to rush.

We can make the sandwich go around the Earth two times and Mary three times, or Mary two times and the sandwich only once.

As long as they meet at point \\(X\\), there is no problem.

So we have a whole family of solutions.

We can have Mary pass that point \\(X\\) \\(n_a\\) times, and we can have the sandwich pass that point \\(X\\) \\(n_s\\) times.

As long as these are integers, that's perfectly fine.

Then ultimately, if they have enough patience, they will meet at point \\(X\\).

And if you take this new concept into account that you can wait a certain number of passages through \\(X\\), then the equation that you see there--the relation between \\(a\\) and \\(R\\)--changes only slightly.

You now get that \\(a = R \left(\frac{n_a - f}{n_s}\right)^{2/3}\\).

And if you substitute \\(n_a = 1\\) and \\(n_s = 1\\), which is the case that they make the catch right away, then you see indeed you get \\(R (1 - f)^{2/3}\\).

Not all solutions that you try will work.

One case that won't work is \\(n_a = 1\\) and \\(n_s = 1\\), which has no solution.

And I'll leave you with the thought why that is the case.

## Simulations of the Passing of the Sandwich

In 1990, when I lectured 8.01 for the first time, I asked my friend and colleague George Clark to write a program so that I could show the class this toss of the sandwich with Mary and Peter in orbit and the sandwich orbit and everything and the catch, and he did.

It was a wonderful program, but that program no longer works because that's called progress.

The computers have changed and so, my right hand, Dave Pooley, offered to rewrite the program so that it works on Athena, and we were going to demonstrate it to you, and you can play with it yourself.

It is available on the homepage, so whatever Dave is going to show you, you can do it yourself.

The input parameters that we need for this program are the radius \\(R\\), our \\(f\\) and our \\(n_a\\) and our \\(n_s\\).

And the program will do all the rest, so you can specify how many times you want Mary to go through point \\(X\\), how many times you want the sandwich to go through point \\(X\\).

The program will then calculate for you the speed of the sandwich.

It will also give you \\(v_s - v_a\\), which is really the speed with which Peter has to throw it, but very cleverly, the program works with a dimensionless parameter which is this value \\(\frac{v_s - v_a}{v_a} = \frac{v_s}{v_a} - 1\\). This number is quite unique, because you get solutions which turn out to be independent of \\(G\\) and independent of \\(M\\), and I'll give you an example.

Suppose you will find for dimensionless number -0.0175, which is the solution for \\(n_a = n_s = 1\\).

So you'll see that.

The computer will generate that number for us.

If now we take our orbit of 7,000 kilometers...we know what \\(v_a\\) is, and so we can calculate now that \\(v_s - v_a = -0.0175 \times 7.55 = -0.13\text{ km/s}\\).

Of course! It has to be that number, because that's what we calculated for our case, \\(n_a = n_s = 1\\).

And so this dimensionless number is very transparent, and we will show you some examples.

This would be the 300 mph, which, of course, is not very doable.

Dave, why don't you demonstrate the program? And then you'll see what we can do with that program.

We can substitute in there quite a few parameters that you will find no doubt interesting.

Give us an explanation, Dave, of what the students can do with this.

Oh, let me show them an overhead here which would help you in following what Dave will be telling you.

You see there the \\(f\\) value? It's always 5% we took, and you're going to see here the number of times that Mary passes through point \\(X\\) and the number of times that the sandwich will pass through point \\(X\\).

This is that very first case that we worked on together.

Here, you see that number -0.0175, and you see indeed that it is a successful catch.

So let's work at that first.

David, explain how it works.

DAVID: Okay, well, you can see in the middle of the screen is planet Earth, and these two triangles represent the astronauts.

![Computer Simulation of Sandwitch Toss][8]

The yellow one is Mary and the red one is Peter, and he's holding the sandwich right in the middle.

They start off at a radius of 22,000 kilometers from the center of the Earth.

That's the default, but you can change that if you'd like.

And we set \\(n_a\\) and \\(n_s\\) through these pulldown menus, so we'll set them both to 1 and 1 now.

And we ask the program to calculate the value for us of this dimensionless parameter, and it comes up with it, and we want to use that value.

And so we have everything set...

LEWIN: That's this number, right, Dave? This -0.0175, etc.

DAVID: Yep, it's right over here.

So then we ask the program to prepare the toss.

We click this button down here, and when it's ready, the green play button will become active.

And when that happens, we can click on that, and it'll play the toss for us.

LEWIN: Peter always throws at \\(X\\), 12:00.

DAVID: Always at 12:00.

LEWIN: There goes the sandwich.

You see the sandwich? Great sandwich.

Big sandwich.

So notice that the sandwich makes it around exactly at the same time for Mary to be happy.

Now there's no reason why we shouldn't try one, too.

So that means Mary reaches point X, but the sandwich went twice around the Earth.

There is no problem with this solution in principle, but you have to be quite far away from the Earth.

If you're too close to the Earth like Dave's orbit, which has a radius of only 22,000 kilometers, something very catastrophic will happen.

DAVID: Yeah, okay, so now we want to set ns to two, and we do that with the pulldown menu.

And we ask it to prepare the toss again, and it goes through its numerical calculations of the orbit.

And when it's ready, it'll let us know.

And now we can watch the toss.

LEWIN: So there goes the sandwich.

It wants to go around the Earth twice, but it hits the Earth.

That's too bad.

If you make this dimensionless parameter -1, then \\(v_s = 0\\).

And what does it mean that \\(v_s = 0\\)?

That the sandwich stands still, has no speed in orbit anymore.

And so what happens with the ellipse, that becomes radial infall.

Dave? 

DAVE: Okay, so if we want to use our own value for this dimensionless parameter, then we can go to this box right here and put in whatever we want, so we'll put in -1.

And we make sure that the program is going to use our value instead of the calculated value.

In this case, these numbers don't matter--\\(n_a\\) and \\(n_s\\).

They're irrelevant, because the program is going to use our value.

We ask it to prepare...

LEWIN: The -1 overrides everything else now.

DAVID: Yes.

It's going through its calculations, and now we can see what happens.

LEWIN: 12:00, there goes the sandwich.

Now, Peter decides at one point that instead of throwing the sandwich backwards, he can also throw the sandwich forward, because, look, we have here the red ellipse.

There's no reason why Mary couldn't go twice through \\(X\\) and then the sandwich would make a larger ellipse and meet here when Mary has gone around twice.

Then, of course, the sandwich has to be thrown forward.

And so Peter makes a calculation for what we call the 2/1 situation.

Mary goes twice through \\(X\\); the sandwich goes once through \\(X\\).

But Peter made a mistake.

Peter got nervous, and he puts in the wrong parameters, and you will see what happens.

Dave will first show you the right parameters.

DAVID: Okay, so if we would have asked the program to calculate it for the case of 2/1, it would have come up with a value for this dimensionless parameter of 0.1659 or something thereabouts.

But, you know, Peter made his miscalculation, and he wants to use 0.164, so this is what we'll put into the program, and we'll prepare the toss and see what happens with this value. 

Okay, now it's ready.

LEWIN: Poor Mary must be hungry by now.

There we go.

Now we go forward.

You can see that.

You see, it goes forward.

It goes a very large ellipse, and Mary will go around twice.

When Mary is here, see, the sandwich is only halfway.

And if Peter had only done it right, Mary's troubles would now soon be over.

But Peter made this small mistake, and Mary cannot catch it.

If you make this dimensionless parameter +0.42, then it's very easy to convince yourself that the sandwich will have the escape velocity from the orbit.

Maybe Peter got angry at one point at Mary--you never know about these situations--and he threw it very fast, and Dave will show you what happens then.

DAVID: Okay.

LEWIN: And it goes to infinity, and it won't be fresh anymore when it gets there.

Okay, see you Friday.
